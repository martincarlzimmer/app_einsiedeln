The history of pilgrimage in Einsiedeln begins with the simple cell of Saint Meinrad (+861), and over the centuries, it has made Einsiedeln the most important Marian pilgrimage site in Switzerland. The pilgrimage in the classical sense certainly dates back to the 12th century in Einsiedeln. Early written records from the early 14th century casually mention pilgrimages to Einsiedeln and also indicate that they were quite significant.';
